# operating_-system_lab
This repository contains the complete solutions for Operating System Lab Sheet 3, implemented in Python.
It covers a range of OS memory and CPU scheduling algorithms, including:

Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)

Round Robin Scheduling

Sequential File Allocation

Indexed File Allocation

Contiguous Memory Allocation (First, Best, Worst Fit)

MFT (Multiprogramming with Fixed Tasks)

MVT (Multiprogramming with Variable Tasks)

📝 Task Summary
Task 1 — CPU Scheduling

Implements:

Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)

Round Robin Scheduling (RR)

Outputs:

Waiting Time (WT)

Turnaround Time (TAT)

Average WT & TAT

Gantt Chart Timeline

Task 2 — Sequential File Allocation

Simulates:

Allocation of files in consecutive disk blocks

Checks for fragmentation + contiguous free space availability

Task 3 — Indexed File Allocation

Simulates:

Index block → list of data blocks

Ensures no overlap and no double allocation

Task 4 — Contiguous Memory Allocation

Implements:

First Fit

Best Fit

Worst Fit

Outputs:

Allocation Table

Remaining Memory after each allocation strategy

Task 5 — MFT and MVT

Simulates:

Fixed partitioning memory management (MFT)

Variable partitioning memory management (MVT)

Internal & external fragmentation
